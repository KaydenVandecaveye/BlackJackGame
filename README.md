<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used:</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 

<h2>Concepts Learned in the Project:</h2>
For some context this was my final project for my 1st year Intro to Programmning class. This project reinforced a lot of the basics of python like loops, conditionals, comparisons, etc. Some new things this project taught me were using the numpy library to assign different probabilites to different outcomes, error checking, and using classes.
